# canon_flutter

**The Flutter binding for the canon runtime — the package a Flutter app installs.** It hosts the router (`Screen.manager` is your `routerDelegate`), scopes screens, entities, and IDENTITY into the widget tree, and turns the store engine into reactive context reads: `store.entityOf(context, id)`, `unitStore.of(context)`, `store.item(id, child:)`, the deictic `ProductID.navOf(context)` faces, `Query`/`Fragment` view-state — surgical rebuilds (per key, per unit, structure-only for lists) as the *default*, not as selector discipline.

The system it binds: **an application runtime context specification.** You declare your app's runtime contexts as grammar trees — screens, entities, stores — and canon projects that spec into navigation, the URL, and state. Everything else hangs off that essence as a property: *compile-safety* is how the projection is realized, and *identity*, when a context has one, is a property **of the context** — ambient within it, read from the runtime, never threaded through application code.

Four packages carry it: **`canon`** (the pure-Dart core: grammar, nav engine, URL model), **`regent`** (pure-Dart stores: message bus, folds, optimistic overlays, request status), **`canon_flutter`** (the widget layer: router host, screen scoping, and reactive store reads with surgical rebuild granularity — per key, per unit, structure-only for lists — as the *default*, not as selector discipline), and **`canon_generator`** (build-time codegen). Non-Flutter consumers — servers, CLIs, tests — use the same spec without a Flutter dependency.

Compile-safe Flutter navigation generated from **one grammar tree**. The transitions you're *allowed* to make are the only methods that exist — an illegal route is a **compile error**, not a runtime crash.

Built for the AI-authorship era: a machine can only emit legal navigation, and a human audits the **entire nav space** at a glance in one small spec.

One grammar, both ends: it drives identical navigation on mobile and the web — typed deep links, view-state mirrored to the URL, and real browser back/forward that survives a refresh. The compile-time closed nav space is the part no other router has; the web fidelity is table stakes, done right.

## The whole app, on one screen

```dart
import 'package:canon/canon.dart';
part 'screen.canon.dart';

@screens
enum _Screens with ScreenNode<_Screens> {
  home(HomeScreen()),
  search(SearchScreen()),
  messages(MessagesScreen()),
  profile(ProfileScreen()),
  user(UserScreen(), .uuid),
  post(PostScreen(), .uuid),
  editPost(EditPostScreen(), .uuid),
  comment(CommentScreen(), .uuid),
  thread(ThreadScreen(), .uuid),
  settings(SettingsScreen());

  const _Screens(this.widget, [this.id]);
  @override final Widget widget;
  @override final Codec? id;

  // A profile: this user's posts, and links to other users (followers).
  static _Screens _user() => user({
    post({ comment, user.cycled }),
    user.stacked,                    // tap a follower → another profile, fresh frame
  });

  static final graph = NavGraph({
    home.keep({ _user() }),
    search.keep({ _user(), comment })
      .query({ _View.text(.string), _View.sort(.enumValues(SortBy.values)) }),  // URL ?text=&sort= — historyless mirror
    messages.keep({ thread({ _user() }).fragment({ _View.at(.uuid) }) }),       // URL #at=<msgId> — a scroll anchor
    profile.keep({
      // editPost's id is always this post's; `dirty` is a shared flag (any editor
      // can mirror it) → a global close-guard can ask "is anything unsaved?"
      post({ editPost.inherit(post).query({ _View.dirty }), comment }),
      settings,
    }),
    user.link({ slot(.username) }),               // /user/<username> — a shareable deep link → user
  }, root: const SplashScreen());              // boot UI, until the resolver commits the first screen
}

// View-state keys (the URL `?query` / `#fragment`) — a QueryKeyBase enum, `key(codec)`.
enum _View with QueryKeyBase { text, sort, at, dirty }
```

A row is `name(WidgetConst())` or `name(WidgetConst(), idCodec)`. One library-private `@screens` enum, one `NavGraph`, `part 'screen.canon.dart';` — that's the whole grammar. Codegen turns this tree into a typed `Screen` facade whose methods *are* its edges. Read this section and you've read the app's navigation; everything below maps to a line in it.

## The core: typed transitions are legal moves

**Without canon** — routes are strings, ids are stringly-typed map lookups:

```dart
context.go('/messages/thraed/$id');     // typo compiles, crashes at runtime
final id = state.params['treadId'];     // wrong key → null → blank screen
```

The typo, the wrong key, the wrong id type — all invisible until a user hits them.

**With canon** — the transition is a generated method that only exists where the edge exists:

```dart
Screen.goThread(id);                    // thread is single-placement → kick-start exists
```

The typo **cannot exist**: there is no `goThraed`. `Screen.goThread()` with no id is a compile error (thread is id-bearing). `Screen.goThread(42)` is a compile error (its id type is `String`). There is no `Screen.goComment` at all — `comment` has two parents, so it has no unambiguous kick-start. **Illegal routes aren't caught; they're unrepresentable — not a string to mistype, not a map to mis-key.**

And `goX` is **non-destructive by construction** — a deep link or push extends from your live position, it never nukes the back stack. Bug class deleted.

## Two ways to move

**Kick-start** — from anywhere; emitted *only* when the target is reachable single-placement with the ids you supply.

```dart
Screen.goHome();
Screen.goSettings();
Screen.goThread(threadId);
```

For a *dynamic* kick-start, `Screen.go(Hop.x)` takes a ternary and returns the landed placement directly — the least-common `…Nav` (a sealed `AnyPlacement` for a cross-screen ternary), switched exhaustively.

**Surgical-chain** — continue from a live position; ids already on the stack are reused. `Screen.on(.path)` returns a placement (a typed `…Nav`) or `null`, each step offers only satisfiable children, and a whole path commits as **one** transition:

```dart
Screen.on(.search)?.goUser(id);                  // .user matches ANY live user
Screen.on(.user(id))?.goPost(postId);            // .user(id) pins one occurrence
Screen.goHome().goUser(authorId).goPost(postId); // chain disambiguates: post lands under THAT user
```

**Atomic** — a chain written in one expression commits as a **single** transition: one diff against the live stack, one animation. Entries that still match (same screen **and** id) are **reused, not rebuilt**, so the chain changes only what actually differs. That's why `Screen.at(.home)?.goSettings()` *pops what's above home and reuses the rest* — a minimal jump, never a teardown-and-recreate — and why a `surface()`-then-`go` reads as a single declarative "end up here."

**Broad reach** — a kick-start's reach extends inward: a *single-placement* id screen gets its `goX(id)` on every ancestor whose path down to it crosses no unrelated id screen (id-free intermediates auto-fill), so an ancestor jumps straight to a descendant supplying just the one id it needs. (`post` is multi-placement, so there's no broad `goPost` — only the direct-child edge above; `editPost` below is the real broad-reach case.)

## Inherit: an id that's provably the parent's

`editPost` is an ordinary `.uuid` screen. Placing it as `editPost.inherit(post)` declares that *in this placement* its id is always `post`'s — which buys two things at once:

- **Sugar** — you never re-pass that id; it's taken from the live `post` (the edge verb has no id param).
- **Guarantee** — there is no slot to inject a *different* id, so the compiler proves `editPost`'s id is 100% this `post`'s. The classic bug — opening an editor on the wrong entity — isn't caught at runtime, it's unrepresentable.

Inherit is per-placement: put `editPost` somewhere without `post` as an ancestor and it's just a normal id screen taking its own id. Transitive — it flattens to the ultimate id source.

```dart
Screen.goEditPost(postId);                          // kick-start: stamps post AND editPost
Screen.on(.post)?.goEditPost();                     // already on post → nothing to pass
Screen.on(.profile)?.goPost(postId).goEditPost();   // give post the id; editPost inherits
Screen.on(.profile)?.goEditPost(postId);            // broad reach: profile → editPost, one id, both pushed
assert(context.idOf(.editPost) == context.idOf(.post)); // inside editPost: always holds — the guarantee
```

## parentOf: push onto whoever hosts you

`comment` has two distinct parents (`post`, `search`). `parentOf` pushes onto whichever currently hosts you, with no branching on where you are:

```dart
Screen.on(.parentOf.comment)?.goComment(id);
Screen.on(.parentOf);                       // compile error — target mandatory
Screen.on(.parentOf.home);                  // compile error — home is a trunk, it has no parent
```

## Recursion: stacked vs cycled

A profile links to other profiles, and a post links back to its author. Two distinct recursions, both explicit in the tree:

- `user.stacked` — drill-in: push a **fresh** instance, keep intermediate frames (follower → follower → follower).
- `user.cycled` — exactly `stacked`, plus one rule: it won't stack a second identical copy of a cycle. If a move would repeat a run of frames (same screens **and** ids) back-to-back, canon drops the repeat and returns you to the existing run; any differing id breaks the match, so it just stacks.

Cyclic screens expose `depth` (live occurrence count); `.depth(n)` pins one:

```dart
if (Screen.current case HomeUserNav(:final depth)) { ... }   // how deep in the chain
Screen.on(.user.depth(2))?.popToUser();                 // act on a specific occurrence
```

## Back

`Screen.canPop` is `null` iff you're at a trunk. `Screen.pop()` is sugar for `Screen.canPop?.pop()` — it pops if it can and returns where you landed (or `null` at a trunk), never throws. That destination is a **sealed `PopDestPlacement`** — one case per non-leaf placement you could land on — so you `switch` on it directly:

```dart
final landed = Screen.pop();        // null at a trunk; else a sealed PopDestPlacement
switch (landed) { /* one case per non-leaf placement — exhaustive */ }
```

`Screen.on(...)`, `Screen.current`, and every move return a **placement** — a typed `…Nav` like `ThreadNav` or `HomeUserNav`. It's a transient cursor: each move returns the **next** placement and you step from that.

```dart
Screen.goThread(threadId).goUser(userId);   // chain off each returned placement
```

A placement is edge-required and single-use — a spent or stale one throws instead of acting from the wrong spot:

```dart
final thread = Screen.goThread(threadId);
thread.goUser(userId);                       // moved off thread
thread.pop();                                // throws — thread is already spent
```

```dart
final thread = Screen.goThread(threadId);
await save();                                // navigation may move on during the gap
thread.goUser(userId);                       // throws IF user is no longer a live edge from here
```

Where a screen has 2+ children or ancestors, `go(Hop.x)` / `popTo(Pop.x)` take a ternary for dynamic branching — `go(busy ? Hop.user(a) : Hop.comment(c))` — returning the least-common placement type; chain off a named verb when you need a specific one.

## Inspect & reach a position — typed, exhaustive

**The bug:** `"is route X active?"` by string/regex compare.

**Foreclosed:** `Screen.current` is the exact foreground placement (never null), a sealed `AnyPlacement` you switch exhaustively. `Screen.on(.user)` is `user`'s placement **if it's the front**, else `null` — and it's already the typed placement, so a placement you forget to handle **won't compile**:

```dart
if (Screen.current case HomeUserNav n) ...      // exact front placement

switch (Screen.on(.user)) {            // no default — add a placement and this won't compile
  case HomeUserNav():            ...
  case SearchUserNav():          ...
  case MessagesThreadUserNav():  ...
  case null:                     ...   // user is not the front
}
```

`Screen.on(.x)` is **front-only**; `Screen.at(.x)` reaches a placement **anywhere on the live stack** — front *or* buried. On it, `surface()` brings it to the front (a no-op if it already is), and `goX()` is a **smart jump** — pop back to it, then navigate, as one atomic diff:

```dart
Screen.at(.user(id))?.surface();       // bring that user up (no-op if already front)
Screen.at(.home)?.goSettings();        // jump back to home, then settings — one diff
```

`Screen.stack` exposes `.current`, `.currentId`, `.screens`, `.reachable`, and `.tab` (the active trunk — the bottom of the stack).

Each reach has two forms. **`Screen.on`/`Screen.at`** read a placement *once* — to inspect or navigate. **`context.on`/`context.at`** are their reactive twins: the same selector, but they return the typed **view** and **rebuild the widget surgically** — only when a key the selector names (or the foreground) actually changes, never on unrelated nav. Two axes: `Screen.` vs `context.` = read-once vs reactive rebuild; `.on` vs `.at` = foreground vs anywhere on the stack. (`Screen.<screen>Of(context)` reads this widget's *own* placement.)

## Read a screen's own id

**The bug:** a mirrored `currentUserId` provider, or id threaded through every constructor — two sources of truth that drift.

**Foreclosed:**

```dart
final userId = context.idOf(.user);   // typed, never null for an id-bearing screen
context.idOf(.home);                  // compile error — home has no id
```

No `InheritedWidget`, no mirror, no route-param threading. (When one widget backs 2+ id-bearing screens, codegen emits a sealed `Screen.<widget>Id(context)` resolver you switch exhaustively — not needed in this tree.)

## View-state: typed URL query/fragment, reactive

`search.query({...})` / `thread.fragment({...})` declare **screen-local view-state** — nullable, typed, mirrored into the URL's `?query` / `#fragment` as a *historyless* replace (it never floods back-history). Write it through the placement; read it surgically in a widget:

```dart
Screen.on(.search)!.query.sort = .recent;          // write — mirrors to ?sort=recent

final text = Query.of<String>(context, _View.text); // read ONE key — rebuilds ONLY when `text` changes
```

`Query.of` / `Fragment.of` are fine-grained: a widget watching a key rebuilds only when *that* key changes — selection rebuilds with no provider/selector boilerplate. `context.on(.x)` reads the typed view through the placement reactively, **subscribing only to the keys (and foreground) the selector references**:

```dart
final search = context.on(.search.query({.sort(.recent)}));  // SearchView? (null off search / when sort ≠ recent)
// rebuilds when `sort` changes value or search (de)foregrounds — never on unrelated nav or other keys;
// no change to a watched value → no rebuild

// global, across screens: a flag read anywhere on the stack — true while ANY
// editor is dirty. Backs a close-guard; rebuilds only when a `dirty` flips.
final unsaved = context.at(.query({.dirty})) != null;
```

`context.on` is the foreground read, `context.at` the same anywhere on the stack; a placement-less `On.query({...})` reads view-state **globally** across screens (the close-guard above). `Screen.ownerOf(context)` / `isForegroundOf(context)` read this widget's own placement, reactively.

## State retention

`keep` / `forget` decide whether a scope's stack **survives leaving it for another trunk** (a kick-start to a different family) and coming back — build-time checked to actually flip inherited state, so a no-op annotation won't compile:

```dart
home.keep({ _user() })   // jump to another trunk and back → home's stack is intact
child.forget()           // this subtree is dropped, rebuilt fresh on return
```

Retention applies only to that trunk switch — a `popTo`/`go` to an ancestor *within* the scope pops the screens above as normal; they're gone.

## The state legs: `@entities` & `@regents`

Navigation is one projection of the spec; **state is the other**. Two more small enums declare the app's entity space and its CITIZENS (pure `regent` folds and judges of message families — the journal is the only truth, every store is a cached fold, and ROW ORDER IS TRAVERSAL ORDER: a guard row protects exactly the rows below it):

```dart
@entities
enum _Entities with EntityNode<_Entities> {
  cart(CartState),                 // keyless — a UNIT: the session is its identity
  product(Product, .product),      // a row binds an entity TYPE to its id node
  review(Review, .review);

  const _Entities(this.type, [this.key]);
  @override final Type type;
  @override final Ids? key;

  static final graph = EntityGraph({
    cart,
    product({review}),             // ownership: reviews live inside their product
  });
}

@regents
enum _Regents with RegentNode<_Regents> {
  cart(CartUnit()),                // Unit — folds the keyless cart facts
  catalogGate(CatalogGate()),      // a VETO row: judges the flow for rows below
  products(ProductsStore());       // Store<ProductId, Product, ProductMsg>

  const _Regents(this.regent);
  @override final Regent regent;

  // Merge edges: a store READS-FROM another through a projection (the
  // shadow/self patterns) — store rows only, both ends.
  static final merges = {
    products.from(localProducts, const LocalProductSupports()),
  };
}

/// A guard judges the ledger's OWN state by citizen identity — pure,
/// replayable, positioned. `read(const X())` is checked at build time:
/// the instance must name a row of the enum.
final class CatalogGate extends Veto<CatalogCacheMsg> {
  const CatalogGate();
  @override
  bool block(Envelope env, CatalogCacheMsg msg, ReadStore read) =>
      read(const CatalogCovered());
}
```

Codegen emits a typed store surface (`productsStore`, `cartStore`) plus surgical **tree ops** derived from the ownership graph (`addReview(productId, review)` and friends). The reads are where this package earns its name — reactive, with the engine deciding granularity **once** instead of every consumer re-deriving it:

```dart
final ids = productsStore.of(context);               // key SEQUENCE — rebuilds on add/remove/reorder ONLY
final product = productsStore.entityOf(context, id); // ONE entity, nullable — rebuilds when THIS key changes
final cart = cartStore.of(context);                  // the unit's value
productsStore.item(id, child: ProductCard());        // list item: plants the EntityScope, self-keyed
```

No selectors, no `listEquals` discipline: the store's fold already computed which keys changed and whether the key *sequence* changed (the `structure` feed), so a value edit rebuilds one card and a list shell rebuilds only when membership does.

**Request status is a ROW, not a field.** An in-flight unit folds the
request fact's key in and the answering facts out — presence is loading,
read with the same reactive surface as any state; a gate reading it drops
duplicate asks at the queue. No `loading` fields in state, no machinery:

```dart
final class ReviewsInFlight extends Unit<Set<ProductId>, Msg> {
  const ReviewsInFlight() : super(const {});
  @override
  Set<ProductId> reduce(Set<ProductId> state, Msg msg) => switch (msg) {
        GetReviews(:final productId) => {...state, productId},
        ReviewsPage(:final id) => {for (final k in state) if (k != id) k},
        _ => state,
      };
}

final loading = reviewsInFlightStore.containsIdOf(context);  // at the ambient id
```

And because the WebSocket is itself a subscriber (`ledger.on<OutMsg>` sends), **`dispatch(fact)` is the app's only verb** — top-level, no prefix: the same call states a local fact, sends a request, and marks its key in flight.

## Ambient identity: the deictic reads and verbs

Every scope PLANTS the identity it holds — the screen its nav id, an
`EntityScope`/`store.item` its item's, a bare `IdScope(id)` anything else —
each tagged with its grammar NODE. The generated per-node faces resolve to
the nearest plant **of their node** (extension types erase, so nearness
alone could hand back the wrong identity wearing the right type — node
matching makes that impossible by construction):

```dart
ProductID.of(context)                       // the typed ambient id
ProductID.navOf(context).go();              // DEICTIC nav: from where this widget
                                            // stands — no chain named, no id passed
ProductID.on(context, On.seller)?.goChat(); // a CLAIMED chain: the composite's other
                                            // component read from the stack; a chain
                                            // that proves nothing is a COMPILE error
ProductID.screenOf(context);                // one source only: the screen's
ProductID.itemOf(context);                  // one source only: the item's
chatsStore.idOf(context);                   // provenance: the scope's id ONLY if
                                            // planted from THIS store (null else)
```

Item widgets never pass the id they stand on; outbound FACTS still carry
their ids explicitly — the id is *read* ambiently, the write stays a
visible, journaled value (`dispatch(SetQty(ProductID.of(context), 3))`).

## Codecs (id types)

The id is a **value-witness**: write a codec and its `T` becomes the screen's static id type (`.uuid` ⇒ `String`). Type safety is that `T` — the codec itself is for **restoration and deep links**, a strict string ↔ `T` round-trip whose `decode` returns `null` to reject malformed input (it validates the *string form*, it doesn't add a finer static type):

`.string .raw .uuid .username .email .integer .number .date .enumValues(...) .record2/.record3(...) .csv(...)` — or any `const` class implementing `Codec<T>`.

## Build a shareable link

The inverse of the resolver: every screen is also a deep link, and the typed builder turns a route into a URL with `.toUri()` — no string-building, every id checked by its codec.

```dart
Link.home.user('u1').toUri()                 // /home/user/u1 — address it the way you'd navigate
Link.editPost('p1').toUri()                  // /profile/post/p1/edit-post — jump straight to an
                                             //   unambiguous screen; the one id back-fills its path
Link.search.query({.text('shoes')}).toUri()  // /search?text=shoes — view-state rides the SAME
                                             //   dot-shorthand set as Screen.on, minus .not
```

`WidgetLink.<route>` is the nav tree (every renderable screen); a `.link` branch adds **resolve-only** leaves on `WidgetlessLink.<route>` (`/<username>` → `username`, no screen yet); `Link.<route>` is both.

## Host & lifecycle

```dart
MaterialApp.router(routerDelegate: Screen.manager)    // THE host — web + mobile, one name

final off = Screen.observe((from, to) { ... });       // post-commit listener, no veto
final snap = Screen.snapshot();                        // manual snapshot
Screen.restore(snap);                                  // best-effort; truncates at first illegal edge
```

`Screen.manager` is the one host — a `RouterDelegate` you wire into `MaterialApp.router(routerDelegate:)`. It owns the stack and system back on mobile and the browser back/forward + URL channel on web. (The single name is deliberate: if the wiring ever changes, the name stays — always pass it where a `RouterDelegate` goes.)

`NavGraph` takes a required `root:` **boot widget** (a splash, shown until the first real screen commits), optional `pageOf` (defaults to `MaterialPage`), and optional `observers`. Mount another enum's screen family with `graft(Other.tree())`.

**Cold start & deep links.** `root:` is a boot widget shown until the first screen commits — the launch URL and every runtime deep link flow through the **one resolver** (see *One model* below); the first commit out of boot **auto-replaces** the splash, leaving no history. The boot widget itself reads `Screen.rootUrl` (the launch link, parsed) only to **tailor the loading UI** — e.g. a profile skeleton when the app opened on a user link — while the resolver does the navigating.

The **navigations stream** (`Screen.navigations` / `Screen.observe`) fires after each commit with the **source and destination stacks** — diff them for transitions, analytics, or restoration.

## One model, web and mobile

The same stack drives both platforms — back means the same thing whether it's the Android button or the browser's. The `root:` widget and one resolver are the whole contract.

The resolver turns any inbound `Url` into navigation, the same way for the launch URL, a mobile deep link, or the browser's back/forward buttons:

```dart
Screen.resolver = (Url? url) => switch (url) {
  Place p => Screen.go(p),     // a nav-mirror path (/profile/post/p1) → go straight there
  UserLink(:final username) => Screen.goUser(username), // a /.link leaf → resolve to a screen
  _ => Screen.goHome(),        // bare / or unknown → default landing
};
```

canon hands the resolver a sealed **`Url?`** — one of: a **`Place`** (a path that mirrors a nav position — go-able, it `implements Hop` so `Screen.go(place)` replays it), a **`Link`** (a resolve-only `.link` leaf carrying data, no screen yet), **`RootUrl`** (bare `/`), or `null` (unparseable). Each parsed `Url` also carries `url.domain` (the inbound `scheme://host[:port]`, e.g. `http://localhost:8787`) — read it in the resolver to branch on origin; it's `null` for a locally-built `Url`.

On web, canon speaks the browser History API directly: `goX`/`push` add entries, surgical jumps `go(-N)` to drop stacks, and the back/forward buttons feed `popstate` straight back through the resolver — so physical back and `Screen.pop()` land identically. A refresh reconstructs the live stack from the stored entry; a real cold-start runs the resolver fresh.

**Cold-start on web is one entry, by design.** A browser won't let a page that the user hasn't interacted with fabricate a back-chain (an anti-trapping rule) — so a deep cold-start `Screen.go(place)` lands a *single* returnable base, not a fanned-out stack. That's exactly why `root.front` exists: it renders the face of that one base entry until the user navigates and real history accrues. **On mobile this constraint doesn't exist at all** — canon owns the stack outright, so `Screen.go(place)` builds the full path immediately. The resolver code is identical on both; only the web honors the activation rule, transparently.

The bottom of the history — the **root** — has three faces the consumer picks via `Screen.root`:

- `Screen.root.anchor()` — a deep cold-start (someone pasted `/profile/post/p1`) keeps a returnable base showing the front screen.
- `Screen.root.passthrough()` — a bare `/` is a spent floor: pressing back from the first real screen exits the app rather than trapping the user.
- the `root:` widget renders `/` itself: read `Screen.root.kind` (null when a real screen is committed) and `Screen.root.front` to either show the current face or whatever home you like.

**Scope:** canon owns an in-memory stack and system back, mirrors the active path and view-state into the URL (`?query`/`#fragment`, historyless), syncs full browser back/forward history on web, builds shareable links with `.toUri()`, and parses inbound ones from the grammar's `.link` branches. `canon_link` remains the standalone, **Flutter-free** URL ↔ sealed-`Link` codec for non-Flutter consumers.

## Guarantees

- **Compile-time:** illegal targets, missing/mistyped ids, and back-at-trunk aren't expressible — the methods don't exist or don't type-check.
- **Build-time validation:** one owner per screen name; every declaration of a name agrees on id type; `inherit` must target a real ancestor with a matching id type; `keep`/`forget` must genuinely flip retention; a name is a screen *or* a `.link` branch at a given position, never both; redundant forms are rejected — a bare leaf (`X`, not `X()`), and no empty `slots({})` (a screen is already linkable by its id).
- **Runtime:** a placement's verbs are edge-required — they throw on a stale-invalid edge rather than silently teleporting. The engine's raw `go`/`pop` are `@internal`; the typed verbs are the only navigation surface.
- **Drift check:** `assert(Screen.isCodegenFresh)` in a test fails if codegen and the live tree diverge.

The payoff: the spec at the top of this file *is* the complete, auditable nav space. A model can only emit legal navigation, and a human reviews every reachable route at a glance.

## The packages

- **`canon`** — the pure-Dart core: grammar, nav engine, URL model.
- **`canon_flutter`** — this package: the router host, screen scoping, reactive store reads, `EntityScope`.
- **`regent`** — pure-Dart stores: the message bus, folds, optimistic overlays, `Awaits`.
- **`canon_generator`** — build-time codegen: the typed `Screen` facade (nav, URL mirror, `.link` ingress + `.toUri()` builders, view-state) and the typed store surface with its tree ops — all from the one spec.
